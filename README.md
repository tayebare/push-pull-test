# push-pull-test
Hopefully this attempt at the pull process will be successful!

Hooray! That worked!! Note that you did not need to create a directory on the cloud drive before cloning. The command line instruction below created a local clone, including a folder:
git clone https://github.com/tayebare/push-pull-test.git

The code below then effected a pull:

push-pull-test tayebare$ git pull origin main

Yes! Now for another iteration of the process...

Lovely! This "git pull origin main" and "git push origin main" loop appears to be working following the initial set up!
